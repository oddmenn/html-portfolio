<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Rahul Kumar, a motivated and detail-concentrating Computer Science graduate student of Lovely Professional University 
  who has practical exposure to Full Stack Development, Cybersecurity, and latest web technologies. 
  I have developed several projects with backend Java, Spring Boot, Python, and the Flask frameworks, 
  front end Angular, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I have excellent knowledge of data structures and algorithms,
  and it gives me an opportunity to create clean and optimized code, I know REST API quite well, how to manage 
  JSON and use databases, MySQL, and SQL Server.</p>

<p>Besides the skills I have in development, I have engaged myself in learning about cybersecurity 
  tools and mechanisms such as Nmap, Metasploit, and Nessus, where I have enrolled in ethical hacking 
  and bug-catching programs to adjust my skills in practice. I am also skilled at version controlling 
  and CI/CD processes in Git, GitHub, and Azure DevOps, which makes me competent enough to work in a collaborative 
  and fast-paced environment. The gap I can fill between the development and secure coding standards assists in the 
  creation of sound and flexible applications.</p>

<p>I am a good problem-solver and communicator and can present strong leadership and teamwork skills both in academia 
  and projects. I always keep myself motivated to learn new technologies like AWS, TensorFlow and Salesforce to keep 
  up with the industry trends. I aspire to perform on profound and innovative software services that can resolve 
  true-life issues and also enhance my technical and social abilities.</p>
